# Phone Verification Feature

## Overview
The Rentify application now includes phone number verification during user registration. Users must verify their phone number with an OTP (One-Time Password) before they can log in and access the application.

## New Features

### üîê **Flexible Login**
- **Login with Email OR Phone Number**: Users can now sign in using either their email address or phone number
- **Smart Detection**: System automatically detects whether the input is an email or phone number
- **Same Password**: Uses the same password regardless of login method

### üì± **Simple Phone Number System**
- **Single Input Field**: Users enter their full phone number including country code
- **International Format**: Supports phone numbers from any country (e.g., +919876543210, +15551234567)
- **No Country Selection**: Simplified user experience with direct phone number input

## How It Works

### 1. Registration Flow
1. User fills out the signup form including:
   - First Name
   - Last Name
   - Email (must be letters+numbers@gmail.com format)
   - **Phone Number** (full number with country code, e.g., +919876543210)
   - Password (must include 1 uppercase, 1 number, 1 special char, min 6 chars)
   - Confirm Password
   - Role (owner/tenant)

2. Upon successful registration:
   - Account is created with the provided phone number
   - 6-digit OTP is generated and sent to the user's phone
   - User is redirected to OTP verification screen

### 2. Phone Verification
1. User enters the 6-digit OTP received via SMS
2. System validates the OTP and marks phone as verified
3. User is redirected to login page
4. Account is now fully activated

### 3. Login Options
- **Option 1**: Login with email (e.g., monal98@gmail.com)
- **Option 2**: Login with full phone number (e.g., +919876543210)
- **Password**: Same password for both methods
- **Verification Required**: Phone must be verified before login
